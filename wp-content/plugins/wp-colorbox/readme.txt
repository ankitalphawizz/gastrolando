`[wp_colorbox_media url="http://example.com/wp-content/uploads/images/overlay.jpg" type="image" hyperlink="click here to pop up image"]`

here, url is the link to the media file that you wish to open in lightbox and hyperlink is the anchor text/image.

`[wp_colorbox_media url="http://example.com/wp-content/uploads/images/overlay.jpg" type="image" hyperlink="http://example.com/wp-content/uploads/images/thumb.jpg"]`
